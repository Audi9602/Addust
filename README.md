<h1>🐦‍🔥Addust</h1>
_Extracts text from pdf to autofill form's fields_

This project is developed mainly for an assignment task. I used few referrences to complete it. I have listed all of them below. Apart from this, installing this project is quite simple. I deployed this project on Render using NPM. Normally the setup looks like:
>1. git clone `git@github.com:Audi9602/Addust.git`
>2. cd Addust
>3. npm install
>4. npm start

But for terminal, I used node server.js to run the project. This project had been successfully deployed at, [ADDUST](https://addust.onrender.com)🎉.
